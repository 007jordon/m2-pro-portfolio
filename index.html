            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A San Francisco native who currently works at JPMorgan Chase, N.A. as a Relationship Banker.</p>
            <p>Currently pursuing passions, mainly in the tech and finance space.</p>
            <p> 
                At a young age, I ran a grueling 8-mile Spartan race and placed within the top 200 out of a pool of
                several thousands competitors. This race taught me many things that I believe have carried over into my
                professional ethics and personality. A vast majority of the obstacles that were seemingly daunting at
                first, but became easier to digest by learning how to break things down and analytical assess what the
                correct move is. These skills are very much applicable in any professional working environment and thus
                have allow me to grow.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I am currently looking to apply my versatile skill set into a professional working environment in the
                Business and Tech industry. I am an eager and persevering personality, adeptly skilled in Interpersonal
                Communication, Sales, Bilingualism, and Customer Satisfaction.
